  The central problems (or goals) of AI research include reasoning, knowledge,
  planning, learning, natural language processing (communication), perception
  and the ability to move and manipulate objects. General intelligence is among
  the field's long-term goals. Approaches include statistical methods,
  computational intelligence, soft computing (e.g. machine learning), and
  traditional symbolic AI.
